=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.25.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.25.1
and the cperl 5.25.2 development releases.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 Removed ' as package seperator

Make something like C<sub foo'bar;> a syntax error.
C<'> is not replaced by C<::> anymore when used as package seperator.
This was deprecated 10 years ago. We fixed the last remaining F<c2ph> core
utility using this last remaining perl4'ism.
See L<[cperl #217]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/217>.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Most NULL ops are now removed in the peephole optimizer. Check for
C<#if defined(PERL_REMOVE_OP_NULL)> in your XS module if you hardcoded
any NULL-sensitive op-tree structure. See how many with C<-Dk>.

=item *

C<-DPERL_FAKE_SIGNATURE> is now default, making most function calls 2x faster.
See L</fake_signatures>

=back

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

[ Within each section, list entries as a =item entry ]

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item App::Cpan 1.64_01

Fixed C<CPAN::Shell->expand("Module", "Bundle::...")> error with Bundles,
a regression from 1.63 and prev. cperl releases up to 5.25.0c.
cperl only.

=item DynaLoader 2.06c

Fixed build dependency for F<dlboot.c>. No excessive rebuilds anymore.

=item Cpanel-JSON-XS 3.0222

- modfl() mingw 4.0 runtime bug [perl #125924]

- Tested with the comprehensive JSON decode spectests from
  http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.html. Not added to core. #72

- decode with BOM: UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.

- fixed detection of final \0 as illegal non-whitespace garbage. Fixes
  spectest 'n_number_then_00'. #72

- warn with unicode noncharacters as in core when not in relaxed mode.
  #74

- fail decode of non-unicode raw characters above U+10FFFF
  when not in relaxed mode.

=item B-C 1.54_14

Fixed IsCOW savepvn, store the last cowrefcnt.
Fixed wrong savepvn length, failing with asan.

=item Net-Ping 2.55

Fixed missing C<_unpack_sockaddr_in> family, which took AF_INET6 for
a AF_INET addr in F<t/500_ping_icmp.t> and F<t/500_ping_icmp_ttl.t>.
Use now a proper default. Detected by the new gitlab ci.

Fixed C<_pack_sockaddr_in> for a proper 2nd argument type, hash or packed
address.

Improved F<500_ping_icmp.t> to try C<sudo -n> for tests requiring root,
plus adding -n fir fixing [RT #118451].
Relaxed more tests failing with firewalled icmp on localhost. [RT #118441]

Fixed C<ping_external> argument type, either packed ip or hostname. [RT #113825]

Fixed wrong skip message in F<t/020_external.t>

=item Pod-HTML 2.22c

Improved parallel testing, relative F<testdir/test$$.lib>.
See L<[RT #118416]|https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=118416>.

=item version  0.9917_02c

Merge latest version with the '_' lyon concensus with the cperl extension
of the optional final 'c' suffix. Extend version::regex for cperl.
Now also parse the 'c' natively.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

XXX Important bug fixes in the core language are summarized here.  Bug fixes in
files in F<ext/> and F<lib/> are best summarized in L</Modules and Pragmata>.

=over 4

=item *

Fixed the range unicode bug. When the right side of the range is a UTF-8 encoded
string, but the left side not, downgrade the right side to native octets.
E.g.

    my $r = chr 255; utf8::upgrade $r; my $num = ("a" .. $r);
    print $num

should print 26 but does 702, because the utf-8 repr. of C<\x{ff}>
is C<"\303\277" [UTF8 "\x{ff}"]>, and the range was incremented from
"a" to "\x{c3}\x{bf}" instead.
See L<[cperl #218]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/218>.

=item *

Fixed several issues with C<-Duseshrplib>, a shared F<libcperl.$so>:

install it (!!),
fix ExtUtils::Embed and B-C compilation and testing,
fix tests on darwin,
fix configuration probe of Term::ReadKey.

=item *

Fixed C<sv_dump> of fbm-magic strings which did previously contain the wrong
"VALID,EVALED" string for a flag which is either VALID or EVALED. cperl only.

=item *

Fixed a cperl-only failure in signatures with default blocks introducing
a new lexical variable. As in C<sub t151($a,$b=do{my $f},$c=1){} t151($x,$x,$x)>.
This failure was only fatal on 32bit + -Duse64bitint systems.

C<SIGNATURE_arg_default_op> does not have a items arg.
See L<[cperl #164]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/164>.
and L<[cperl #213]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/213>.

=item *

v-strings with a 'c' suffix can now be parsed natively, in C<scan_vstring()>.
See L<[cperl #211]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/211>.

=head1 Known Problems

For open cperl problems see L<[issues]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/>.

Some of these fixes also can to be backported from perl5.25.x upstream.

=over 4

=item *

The perl debugger doesn't yet work with signatures. It doesn't step into
such functions and it may fail.
See e.g. L<[cperl #167]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/167>

=item *

F<t/op/taint.t> contained a test with signatures and 6 default
arguments, which on some 32 bit systems led to random "Reference
parameter cannot take default value at op/taint.t line 2461"
compile-time failures. This test has been rewritten to ony use 4 arguments.

See L<[cperl #164]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/164>

=item *

C<clang -flto=thin> and on some systems even C<gcc -flto> with C<-O3>
or C<-finline> leads to invisible symbols which were inlined and not
exported, even if they should be declared as public API. Work is
ongoing in the F<feature/gh186-lto-thin> branch, but there the
inlining is disabled by the C<used> attribute, leading to a
10% performance regression.  On the other hand a working
C<clang-3.9 -flto> leads to 20% performance improvements.

=item *

C< until ($x = 1) { ... } > and C< ... until $x = 1 > should
warn when syntax warnings are enabled.
L<[perl #127333]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127333>

=item *

C< ${\vec %h, 0, 1} > and C< ${\substr %h, 0} > should not segfault, rather
the lvalue context should be propagated, and list context properly handled.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
